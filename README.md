Ahoy, I'm **Nichloya** â€” a sisadmin and StH romhacker, and also [TheBlad768](https://github.com/TheBlad768)'s younger sister. Since 2017, he has been raising me as a StH hacker and now we work together.   
Sometimes, when I'm in the mood, I draw doodles and mess around with the computer while listening to bossa nova or lurking some about <img width="16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Nuvola_Interslavic_flag.svg"> *MedÅ¾uslovjansky jÄ™zyk* <img width="16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Nuvola_Interslavic_flag.svg"> and Glagolitic script.

# ðŸ”§ What I can
<img align="right" width="70" src="https://github.com/Nichloya/nichloya.github.io/blob/main/riva.png">

I work with GNU/Linux systems, in particular with the tortures it brings (recompiling SDL/GLFW libraries just to play games under Gentoo+Wayland). These skills came in handy when I added KosinskiPlusM support to [Flex 2](https://github.com/Nichloya/Flex2) I'd never worked with Electron before, but it only took me a few hours ðŸ˜Ž.   
As StH romhacker I can't program in M68K assembler, but I know a little about Mega Drive hardware and I can work with art/level editors. Check what TheBlad768 and I made! [link to S1S3-S.C.E-](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-) ðŸ¦”.
