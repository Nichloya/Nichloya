Ahoy, I'm **Nichloya** — a&nbsp;sisadmin and StH&nbsp;romhacker, and also [TheBlad768](https://github.com/TheBlad768)'s younger sister. Since 2017, he has been raising me as a StH&nbsp;hacker and now we work together.   
Sometimes, when I'm in the mood, I draw doodles and mess around with the computer while listening to bossa&nbsp;nova or lurking some about <img width="16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Nuvola_Interslavic_flag.svg" style='display:inline;'>&nbsp;*Medžuslovjansky&nbsp;język*&nbsp;<img width="16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Nuvola_Interslavic_flag.svg" style='display:inline;'> and Glagolitic&nbsp;script.

# 🔧 What I can
<img align="right" width="70" src="https://github.com/Nichloya/nichloya.github.io/blob/main/riva.png">

I work with GNU/Linux&nbsp;systems, in particular with the tortures it brings (recompiling SDL/GLFW libraries just to play games under Gentoo+Wayland). These skills came in handy when I added KosinskiPlusM support to [Flex&nbsp;2](https://github.com/Nichloya/Flex2). I'd never worked with Electron before, but it only took me a few hours&nbsp;😎.   
As StH&nbsp;romhacker I can't program in M68K assembler, but I know a little about Mega Drive hardware and I can work with art/level editors. Check what TheBlad768 and I made! [link to S1S3-S.C.E-](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-)&nbsp;🦔.
